# Building Docker Image

This folder contains everything needed to build the Docker image.  
The Docker image is built in the GitLab CI pipeline and stored in the IServ Docker registry.  
If you make changes to the patches or the Dockerfile and want to test a new image, you can either build it locally or in the pipeline.

## How it works

- The image is based on the official Nextcloud Docker [nextcloud/docker](https://github.com/nextcloud/docker).
- The source code in the image is then modified by [a number of patches or added files that disable or alter functionality](#documentation-of-patches--customizations).
  - These patches are located in `./source/patches/`.
  - There is exactly one patch file for every changed file.
  - Completely new files are located in `./source/added/`.
- The patches were created based on [nextcloud/server](https://github.com/nextcloud/server) and [nextcloud/activity](https://github.com/nextcloud/activity).

When the Docker image is built, in the first stage, `clone_and_apply_patches.sh` applies patches and copies the added files into a freshly checked-out working copy of Nextcloud.  
Then `create_combined_patches.sh` builds the JavaScript assets and creates temporary (binary) patch files representing all changes.  
These binary patches will be applied to the production code in the second build stage.

## Build the image

### Locally

* Run [`docker/cloudfiles/build_image.sh`](docker/cloudfiles/build_image.sh) to build the image.  
* The image will be saved as `./data/image.tar.xz`.  
* You can then transfer the image to your IServ VM and run `iservchk cloudfiles` to restart the container with the new image.

If you are on an architecture other than linux/x86_64, the image ID comparison in iservchk will fail because Docker generates a different one:  
- Make sure you have the newest tarball in the data folder, then update the image:  
- `iservchk cloudfiles`  
  - It will report a failure when updating and importing the image (due to the ID mismatch that can't be repaired)  
  - It should still start the container regardless  
- Run `docker inspect --format='{{.Id}}' registry.git.iserv.eu/iserv/docker-cloudfiles:latest`  
  - Retrieve the image ID that the target architecture references  
- Put this ID into [image.id](../../data/image.id)  
- Now iservchk will no longer complain

### In CI

* Simply push your changes and wait for the pipeline to finish.  
* The image will be built and pushed to the IServ Docker registry, tagged with your last commit SHA.  
* Run `download_image.sh` to download the image tagged with the current commit SHA from the IServ Docker registry.  
* You can also pass a specific tag to `download_image.sh` to download a particular image version (e.g., `latest`).

_To download images from the registry, you must be logged into the `git.iserv.eu` Docker registry._  
To log in, create an [Access Token](https://git.iserv.eu/-/user_settings/personal_access_tokens) with the `read_registry` scope and run `docker login git.iserv.eu:443 -u <your.username>`  
Enter the token as the password.  
(Caution: Do not log in on your VM if others might have access to your session.)

### Building on the VM

You can also build the image directly on your IServ VM.

- SSH into your VM
- Ensure your automatic deployment (e.g., rsync) does not overwrite the image created in the next step.  
- Run `./docker/cloudfiles/build_image.sh`  
- If building the image fails and you receive a SIGINT, you probably need more memory [-> OpenNebula](https://cloud0.iserv.eu/); 16GB should be sufficient.

## Manually restarting the container with a new image

If for some reason you need to manually restart the container with a new image, you can do so by following these steps:

- Remove running containers created from the cloudfiles image
  ```bash
  RUNNING_CONTAINERS=$(docker ps --filter "ancestor=registry.git.iserv.eu/iserv/docker-cloudfiles" -q)
  if [ -n "$RUNNING_CONTAINERS" ] ; then
    docker rm -f $RUNNING_CONTAINERS
  fi
  ```  
- Remove the image  
  `docker image rm registry.git.iserv.eu/iserv/docker-cloudfiles`
- Import the new image tarball  
  `docker load -i data/image.tar.xz`
- Start the container with the new image `iservchk cloudfiles`


## How to create new patches

### 1. Clone Nextcloud and apply existing patches  
- `rm -rf ~/nextcloud-server`
- `./docker/cloudfiles/source/clone_and_apply_patches.sh 29.0.16 ~/nextcloud-server`  
  - arg1: Nextcloud version currently used for the image  
    - You can find the current version in the [.env](.env) file.  
  - arg2: destination path for the repo that gets temporarily checked out.

- The existing patches should be applied correctly, and the `~/nextcloud-server` repo should show several changes/untracked files when running `git status`.

### 2. Code your patch  
- Make your modifications **without adding and committing anything** to the Nextcloud project.
  - If you create a new patch, PHPStorm adds it directly.
  - To prevent this go to Settings > Version Control > Confirmation > Set "When files are created" to "Do not add"
- Remember to add your changes here [Patches_documentation.md](../../doc/patch_list.md).

### 3. Extract patches  
- Return to this project and run  
- `./docker/cloudfiles/source/extract_patches.sh ~/nextcloud-server`  
  - This will create or update files in `./source/added/` and `./source/patches/`.

### 4. Installing/Testing
- Build the Docker image (see section [Building the container](#Build-the-image)). 
- `iservchk` to restart the container with the new image.
- Test your changes.

### 5. Committing  
- Do not commit the Docker image tarball `./data/image.tar.xz` or the image ID `./data/image.id` to git.  
- Commit patches:  
  - `./source/added/`  
  - `./source/patches/`.

If patches need to be created for Nextcloud apps, corresponding changes must be made to the scripts `clone_and_apply_patches.sh`, `create_combined_patches.sh`, and `extract_patches.sh`.

### Patching a new app

If patches need to be applied to an app that has not been patched yet, make sure to update the following scripts as well:

* Dockerfile
* clone_and_apply_patches.sh
* create_combined_patches.sh
* extract_patches.sh

## Handling failed patches

1. Move the affected patch file out of `./source/patches`.
2. Run `clone_and_apply_patches.sh 29.0.16 ~/nextcloud-server` again.  
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all remaining patches have been applied successfully.
4. Manually apply the changes of the moved patch files to the affected files in the working copy `~/nextcloud-server`.  
5. Check if (non-)core apps need to be upgraded.
6. Run `extract_patches.sh ~/nextcloud-server` to regenerate the patches.

## Running the image

This image is specifically tailored for IServ's use-case. It can be embedded into IServ as an iframe. It fetches users, authenticates them with IServ, and allows other IServ modules to access its data securely.  
This means some volumes and environment variables required may not be useful to everyone, such as `LDAP_BASE_DN` or `/ldap_pass.txt`.

Also, to avoid storing the source code on the host in a volume, we use `tmpfs` for the entire `/var/www/html` folder and handle installation/updates/restarts in our entrypoint script.

All variables documented [here](https://github.com/nextcloud/docker/blob/20327851c8d9f7b40606844dfdccef5ee2230355/README.md#auto-configuration-via-environment-variables) are available in addition to:  
* `ISERV_DOMAIN`: used to set CSP to allow iframe embedding  
* `LDAP_BASE_DN`: used for LDAP configuration

The following files/volumes are required by this image:  
- `/version`: used by our entry script to manage updates  
- `/var/log/cloudfiles`: if using our `iserv.config.php`, logs will be saved here  
- `/sp_certificate.pem`  
- `/sp_key.pem`  
- `/idp_certificate.pem`  
- `/ldap_pass.txt`

If using `tmpfs` for the `/var/www/html` folder as mentioned earlier, the `NEXTCLOUD_DATA_DIR` environment variable must also be set to a volume-mounted persistent path.
